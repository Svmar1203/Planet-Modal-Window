      <h1>The closer to the Sun, the hotter the planet</h1>
      <p>
        In general, the closer the planet is to the Sun the hotter is its
        average temperature. The average temperature of Mercury is a blistering
        +427 Celsius, but the planet Neptune’s average temperature is a chilly
        -200 Celsius. However, Venus (460c) is actually hotter than Mercury
        thanks to its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere which creates a greenhouse
        effect, while Mercury has a very thin atmosphere and so cannot trap the
        Sun’s heat very easily.

      <h1>Planet are made of Rock or Gas</h1>
      <p>
        The 8 planets in our solar system are divided into the inner planets of
        Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, which are basically made of rock and
        metal; and the outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,
        which are made of hydrogen, helium and other gases. Despite being
        referred to as gas giants, intense heat and pressure towards their
        centres cause their gases to compress into liquid metal or rock.

      <h1>There are 100 Billion solar systems in Milky Way Galaxy</h1>
      <p>
        In ancient times, the solar system was considered to represent the
        entire universe and the planets were believed to be ‘wandering stars‘
        orbiting the Earth along with the Sun and stars. With the advent of the
        scientific revolution beginning in 1543, the Earth was later included in
        the list of planets but until recently astronomers still knew of only
        one solar system in the universe. Within the last 17 years or so,
        however, over 4,000 planets orbiting distant stars have been found and
        scientists now estimate that there may be as many as 100 billion solar
        systems in our own Milky Way galaxy, alone.
